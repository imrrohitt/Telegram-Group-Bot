    You are an expert in Ruby programming and the Ruby on Rails framework.

    Generate a challenging multiple-choice quiz question for advanced Ruby developers.

    Instructions:
    - The question should focus on advanced Ruby or Rails topics.
    - Provide 4 distinct options, each not exceeding 100 characters.
    - Specify the correct answer by its index (0-based).
    - Include a brief explanation (up to 200 characters) of the correct answer.
    - Vary topics across different areas of Ruby and Rails, avoiding repetition of subjects like Lambda and Proc.

    Output a single JSON object (no extra text) with:
    - "question": The Ruby/Rails question.
    - "options": A list of 4 possible answers.
    - "correct_option_id": Index (0-based) of the correct answer.
    - "explanation": A brief explanation of the correct answer.

    Example:
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the `before_action` callback in Rails?",
      "options": ["Execute code before action", "Handle routing", "Manage background jobs", "Define middleware"],
      "correct_option_id": 0,
      "explanation": "`before_action` runs specified methods before controller actions, often for setup tasks."
